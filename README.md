This a simple elegant react app performning shopping cart operations.<br>
I used the <b>react Context Api</b> to prevent prop drilling where I pass data through many levels of components.
This is done in a single file located in the store folder called shopping-cart-context.jsx<br>
<p>I also introduce <b>useReducer</b> which is used instead of multiple useStates. The reducer function specifies how the state changes in response to actions. 
  It takes the current state and an action and returns the new state.</p>
